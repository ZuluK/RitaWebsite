				<p>
                    Roxana Melgarejo has been in the real estate and mortgage markets for almost a decade, working 
					for buyers and sellers from all over the Bay Area. Her interest in real estate began back in 
					1999, when she purchased her first condominium in the Bay Area. Much intrigued by the market 
					and greatly admiring her realtor, she has dedicated herself to providing her clients with the 
					best service and resources. 
				</p>
                <p>
					Roxana&#146;s knowledge and experience in Single Family Homes, Condos, 
					Lofts and New Developments have helped her negotiate successfully many transactions for her 
					clients in the Bay Area. She prides herself on a caring professionalism that makes complex 
					transactions as smooth as possible for all her clients, from the first-time homebuyer to the 
					seasoned real estate investor. 						
        		</p>
                <p>
					Roxana was born in Lima-Peru, and at fifteen, she moved to California with her family. After graduating high
					school and attending college in Hayward California, she chose to travel the world. She began a 
					career as a Flight Attendant with one of the top four U.S. Carriers: Northwest Airlines. Based at 
					different hubs – Michigan, Minneapolis, New York City, and beautiful San Francisco – allowed her to 
					learn more about America and visit many countries in Europe, Asia, and Central and South America.
				</p>
                <p>
					With her solid foundation in customer service, honed from fourteen years of experience as a flight 
					attendant, Roxana has great communication and people skills. Bilingual in Spanish and English, she 
					can negotiate successfully the hot retirement/resort properties in Mexico and South America as well 
					as the intricacies of the Bay Area housing market. 
				</p>
                <p>
					She is an active member of the San Francisco Association of Realtors and the National and California 
					Association of Realtors. Contact the RnR Team for a complementary consultation, from homes, condominiums
